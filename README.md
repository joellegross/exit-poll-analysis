#  Exit Poll Analysis Modeling 
**Joelle Gross | Summer 2025 Master's Practicum**

This project compiles, visualizes, and models U.S. presidential election exit poll data to provide state-level estimates of vote share, in states with and without exit polls. It includes:
- A multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) modeling pipeline
- A cleaned archive of historical exit poll data
- Evaluation of model accuracy and robustness
- A public-facing interactive dashboard

##  Project Overview

Exit polls offer a real-time glimpse into voter demographics and preferences, but they are only conducted in a subset of states. This project tackles the question:  
**Can we use historical data and demographic modeling to estimate how states without exit polls will vote?**

To answer this, I compiled a cleaned archive of exit poll data, applied MRP using Census microdata and official election returns, and, additionally, built a dashboard for exploring the exit poll archive

## Analysis Overview

### 1. Data Sources
- **Exit Poll Data**: [Roper Poll and NBC News archives, cleaned into CSV format (https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/elections-and-presidents/exit-polls)] 
- **Election Returns**: [MIT Election Data and Science Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/)
- **Census Microdata**: [American Community Survey (ACS 5-Year PUMS via `tidycensus`) (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/access.html)] 

### 2. Modeling
- Multilevel logistic regression via `rstanarm`
- Poststratification using Census demographics
- Model trained on states with exit polls, generalized to those without

### 3. Evaluation
- Accuracy assessed with MAE, RMSE, R^2 and correct-winner classification
- Regression analysis of prediction error across years and states

##  Bonus: Visualization Dashboard
- Dynamic visualizations of exit poll responses  
- Filter by year, state, party, and exit poll question 
- Includes vote share estimates for all 50 states via MRP  
- Powered by historical data from 1998–2024
- Replication code for the dashboard can be found on this [github page (https://github.com/joellegross/exit-poll-dashboard)].

## Key Findings

- MRP effectively predicts vote share in states with and without exit polls.
- Presence of an exit poll does **not** consistently reduce prediction error.
- Demographic predictors such as race, education, can skew modeling reuslts
